	a scientific data publication model on top of linked data and introduce
	the notion of Research Objects as first class citizens for sharing

  abstract = {The paper discusses the semantic Web and Linked Data. The classic
	World Wide Web is built upon the idea of setting hyperlinks between
	Web documents. These hyperlinks are the basis for navigating and
	crawling the Web.Technologically, the core idea of Linked Data is
	to use HTTP URLs not only to identify Web documents, but also to
	identify arbitrary real world entities.Data about these entities
	is represented using the Resource Description Framework (RDF). Whenever
	a Web client resolves one of these URLs, the corresponding Web server
	provides an RDF/ XML or RDFa description of the identified entity.
	These descriptions can contain links to entities described by other
	data sources.The Web of Linked Data can be seen as an additional
	layer that is tightly interwoven with the classic document Web. The
	author mentions the application of Linked Data in media, publications,
	life sciences, geographic data, user-generated content, and cross-domain
	data sources. The paper concludes by stating that the Web has succeeded
	as a single global information space that has dramatically changed
	the way we use information, disrupted business models, and led to
	profound societal change.},

	about their projects, publications, and members, there is no well-established
	standard for doing so, and thus the value of this data is reduced,
	e.g. in terms of accessibility, discoverability, and reusability.
	Linked Data is a method of publishing and linking structured data
	on the Web using RDF (Resource Description Framework). We propose
	LinkedLab: a Linked Data based solution for data management regarding
	research communities. The use of Linked Data affords a more effective
	way to access, organize, and integrate this data. LinkedLab is organized
	into three major parts: the LinkedLab ontology, the LinkedLab nodes,
	and the LinkedLab integrator. The ontology presents a unified view
	of structured data stored across multiple LinkedLab nodes, enabling
	data integration by the integrator. The combination of these parts
	provides all necessary requirements to maximizing the potential benefits
	of Linked Data in the research environment.},
