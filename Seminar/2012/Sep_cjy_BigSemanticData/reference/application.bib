  abstract = {Streams of events appear increasingly today in various Web applications
	such as blogs, feeds, sensor data streams, geospatial information,
	on-line financial data, etc. Event Processing (EP) is concerned with
	timely detection of compound events within streams of simple events.
	State-of-the-art EP provides on-the-fly analysis of event streams,
	but cannot combine streams with background knowledge and cannot perform
	reasoning tasks. On the other hand, semantic tools can effectively
	handle background knowledge and perform reasoning thereon, but cannot
	deal with rapidly changing data provided by event streams. To bridge
	the gap, we propose Event Processing SPARQL (EP-SPARQL) as a new
	language for complex events and Stream Reasoning. We provide syntax
	and formal semantics of the language and devise an effective execution
	model for the proposed formalism. The execution model is grounded
	on logic programming, and features effective event processing and
	inferencing capabilities over temporal and static knowledge. We provide
	an open-source prototype implementation and present a set of tests
	to show the usefulness and effectiveness of our approach.},

	growing need for an efficient mechanism for storing and performing
	inference over these streams. In this poster, we present a tool that
	stores these streams in a unified model by combining memory and disk
	based mechanisms. We explore various memory management algorithms
	and disk-persistence strategies to optimize query performance. Our
	unified model produces an optimized query execution and inference
	performance for RDF streams that benefit from the advantages of using
	both, memory and disk.},
