  abstract = {In the last years, reasoning over very large ontologies became more
	and more important. In our contribution, we propose a reasoning infrastructure,
	which can perform instance checking and instance retrieval over ontologies
	with semi-expressive terminological knowledge and large assertional
	parts.The key idea is to 1) use modularizations of the assertional
	part, 2) use some kind of intermediate structure to find similarities
	between individual modules, and 3) store information efficiently
	on external memory. For evaluation purposes, experiments on benchmark
	and real world ontologies were carried out. We show that our reasoning
	infrastructure can handle up to 1 billion ABox assertions. To the
	best of our knowledge this is the first system to provide sound and
	complete reasoning over SHI ontologies with such a huge number of
	assertions.},

  abstract = {SAQ (Semantic Archive and Query) is a system for long-term preservation
	and querying of relational data in terms of RDF. In SAQ relational
	data in a back-end DBMS is exposed as an RDF view, called the RD-view.
	SAQ can process arbitrary SPARQL queries to the RD-view. Long-term
	preservation as RDF of selected parts of a relational database is
	specified by SPARQL queries to the RD-view. Such queries usually
	select sets of RDF properties and thus in the query definition a
	property p is unknown. We call such queries unbound-property queries.
	This class of queries is also present in the SPARQL benchmarks. We
	optimize unbound-property queries by introducing a query transformation
	algorithm called Group Common Terms, GCT. It pulls out from a DNF
	normalized query those common terms that can be translated to SQL
	predicates accessing the relational database. Our experiments using
	the Berlin SPARQL benchmark show that GCT improves substantially
	the query execution time to a back-end commercial relational DBMS
	for both selective and unselective unbound-property queries. We compared
	the performance of our approach with the performance of other systems
	processing SPARQL queries over views of relational databases and
	showed that GCT improves scalability compared to the approaches used
	by the other systems.},

	Our system featurestwo unique characteristics that enable efficient
	processingof both simple and multi-join SPARQL queries on virtuallyunlimited
	number of triples: A query planner that enablesadaptive decisions
	over both the join order as well as thejoin execution; and join algorithms
	that execute joins according to query selectivity to reduce processing.
	We haveevaluated H2RDF against state-of-the-art RDF stores: Oursystem
	achieves the best of both worlds, answering simplejoins as fast as
	centralized stores and greatly outperformingboth distributed and
	centralized schemes for large, multiple-join queries. In this demonstration
	we showcase the system'sfunctionality through an interactive GUI.
	Users will be ableto execute predefined or custom-made SPARQL queries
	ondatasets of different sizes, using different join algorithms.Moreover,
	they can repeat all queries utilizing a differentnumber of cluster
	resources. Using real-time cluster monitoring and detailed statistics,
	participants will be able tounderstand the advantages of different

	properties ofH2RDF over both the data size and the available workerresources.},
