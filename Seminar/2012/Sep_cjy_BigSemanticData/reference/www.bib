  abstract = {Streams of events appear increasingly today in various Web applications
	such as blogs, feeds, sensor data streams, geospatial information,
	on-line financial data, etc. Event Processing (EP) is concerned with
	timely detection of compound events within streams of simple events.
	State-of-the-art EP provides on-the-fly analysis of event streams,
	but cannot combine streams with background knowledge and cannot perform
	reasoning tasks. On the other hand, semantic tools can effectively
	handle background knowledge and perform reasoning thereon, but cannot
	deal with rapidly changing data provided by event streams. To bridge
	the gap, we propose Event Processing SPARQL (EP-SPARQL) as a new
	language for complex events and Stream Reasoning. We provide syntax
	and formal semantics of the language and devise an effective execution
	model for the proposed formalism. The execution model is grounded
	on logic programming, and features effective event processing and
	inferencing capabilities over temporal and static knowledge. We provide
	an open-source prototype implementation and present a set of tests
	to show the usefulness and effectiveness of our approach.},

	Our system featurestwo unique characteristics that enable efficient

	number of triples: A query planner that enablesadaptive decisions
	over both the join order as well as thejoin execution; and join algorithms
	that execute joins according to query selectivity to reduce processing.
	We haveevaluated H2RDF against state-of-the-art RDF stores: Oursystem
	achieves the best of both worlds, answering simplejoins as fast as
	centralized stores and greatly outperformingboth distributed and
	centralized schemes for large, multiple-join queries. In this demonstration
	we showcase the system'sfunctionality through an interactive GUI.
	Users will be ableto execute predefined or custom-made SPARQL queries
	ondatasets of different sizes, using different join algorithms.Moreover,
	they can repeat all queries utilizing a differentnumber of cluster

	effort. However, none of the currently existing QA system can reliably
	generate such queries over large and heterogeneous knowledge base,
	which we can commonly find in the web of data. In this paper, we
	propose an approach, which is based on generating templates from
	natural language questions. Those templates are instantiated to form
	a set of SPARQL queries, which are then tested using several optimisations.
	We show the feasibility of the approach by successfully applying
	it on an existing QA benchmark.},
