	the requirements for reasoning on a Web scale and performance of
	the existing reasoning engines. The performance limitation can be

	as LarKC - the Large Knowledge Collider - an experimental platform
	for massive distributed incomplete reasoning, which offers several
	innovative approaches removing the scalability barriers, in particularly,
	by enabling transparent access to HPC systems. Efficient utilization
	of such resources is facilitated by means of parallelization being
	the major element for accomplishing performance and scalability of

	part, 2) use some kind of intermediate structure to find similarities
	between individual modules, and 3) store information efficiently
	on external memory. For evaluation purposes, experiments on benchmark
	and real world ontologies were carried out. We show that our reasoning
	infrastructure can handle up to 1 billion ABox assertions. To the
	best of our knowledge this is the first system to provide sound and

  abstract = {Since the first publication of RDF researchers developed systems to
	store and to query RDF data efficiently. First, they mapped the RDF
	data model to the relational one. As relational databases performed
	poorly for generic RDF graphs researches focused on native repositories
	using B-trees to index triples in most cases. However, native repositories
	still calculate the result of a query by joining single triples.Because
	queries can be decomposed into star-like graph patterns we argue
	that managing RDF data as a set of subgraphs has advantages over
	existing approaches. Thus, we propose a storage model that manages
	an RDF graph as a collection of subgraphs and evaluates queries by
	joining the results of star-like subqueries. In cause of the results
	of some preliminary tests we are confident that a system based on
	our approach can efficiently process queries.},

  year = {2011},
  abstract = {SAQ (Semantic Archive and Query) is a system for long-term preservation
	and querying of relational data in terms of RDF. In SAQ relational
	data in a back-end DBMS is exposed as an RDF view, called the RD-view.
	SAQ can process arbitrary SPARQL queries to the RD-view. Long-term
	preservation as RDF of selected parts of a relational database is
	specified by SPARQL queries to the RD-view. Such queries usually
	select sets of RDF properties and thus in the query definition a
	property p is unknown. We call such queries unbound-property queries.
	This class of queries is also present in the SPARQL benchmarks. We
	optimize unbound-property queries by introducing a query transformation
	algorithm called Group Common Terms, GCT. It pulls out from a DNF
	normalized query those common terms that can be translated to SQL
	predicates accessing the relational database. Our experiments using
	the Berlin SPARQL benchmark show that GCT improves substantially
	the query execution time to a back-end commercial relational DBMS
	for both selective and unselective unbound-property queries. We compared
	the performance of our approach with the performance of other systems
	processing SPARQL queries over views of relational databases and
	showed that GCT improves scalability compared to the approaches used
	by the other systems.},
