  abstract = {Performance is the most critical aspect towards achieving high scalability
	of Semantic Web reasoning applications, and considerably limits the
	application areas of them. There is still a deep mismatch between
	the requirements for reasoning on a Web scale and performance of
	the existing reasoning engines. The performance limitation can be
	considerably reduced by utilizing such large-scale e-Infrastructures
	as LarKC - the Large Knowledge Collider - an experimental platform
	for massive distributed incomplete reasoning, which offers several
	innovative approaches removing the scalability barriers, in particularly,
	by enabling transparent access to HPC systems. Efficient utilization
	of such resources is facilitated by means of parallelization being
	the major element for accomplishing performance and scalability of
	semantic applications. Here we discuss application of some emerging
	parallelization strategies and show the benefits obtained by using
	such systems as LarKC.},
